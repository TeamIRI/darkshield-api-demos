Postman is an application for designing, organizing, and sending requests to APIs.

The *DarkShield.postman_collection.json* file contains an assortment of sample DarkShield API requests that can be imported into Postman.

The working directory setting for Postman should be set to the folder of this demo in order to successfully use any of the requests that involve files.
