# DarkShield Files API: DynamoDB

This example demonstrates the use of the *darkshield-files* API to search and 
mask items in a DynamoDB table. To run, the *plankton* web services API 
must be hosted on *http://localhost:8959* and must have the *darkshield* and 
*darkshield-files* plugins installed.

We recommend that you download and host a [local dynamodb](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html) 
for testing purposes, and use the *endpoint* flag to specify the local instance
(for example, *https://localhost:8000*).

To install the additional dependencies, execute *pip install -r requirements.txt* 
(make sure your virtual environment is activated, or your dependencies will 
be installed globally).

The setup script will also download the NER and sentence detection models from 
the [OpenNLP website](http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/) if not present 
in the parent directory. If you are having trouble downloading the models, place 
the *en-ner-person.bin*, *en-sent.bin*, and *en-token.bin* files into the 
parent directory.

The example will find and mask the following:

1. Emails (EmailMatcher): Found using a regular expression and masked using a 
hashing function.
2. Phone Numbers (PhoneMatcher): Found using a regular expression and masked 
using format-preserving encryption.
3. Names (NameMatcher): Found using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model AND 
using format-specific json paths (all names can be found in the 'name' key/
tag, regardless of nesting).

To execute, run *python main.py table_name*. The script will use the *default*
profile in your AWS credentials file in order to access the dynamodb table unless the
*profile* flag is included. See the [boto3 quickstart guide](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration)
for more information on how to configure this file.

If a *region* flag is specified, a different region name is used than the one that is
stored in the *credentials* or *config* files. You may instead specify an *endpoint*
flag which allows you to construct the full endpoint url yourself.

By default, the demo scans the table in batches (creating it if it doesn't exist 
and populating it with test data from *data.json* if it is empty), sneding the data
to be searched and masked to the API. The masked batches are then put back into
the source table unless a *target* flag is specified. The log files of the masking
operations are stored inside of the *results* folder.

You may also specify the *delete-existing* flag to delete the source and target
tables if they exist before running the demo. The code will make sure to re-create
the source and target tables as needed.

Note that you should NOT use this code as is in production. Modifications are needed
for Proper error handling in DynamoDB needs. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.Errors.html)
for a detailed guide on how to implement it.
