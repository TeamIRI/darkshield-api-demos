# DarkShield Files API: X12 Search/Masking

This example demonstrates the use of the *darkshield-files* API to search and 
mask text files. To run, the *plankton* web services API must be hosted on 
the location specified in server_config.py (by default *http://localhost:8959*) and must have the *darkshield* and *darkshield-files* 
plugins installed.

Names (NamesMatcher): Use the Named Entity Recognition (NER) matcher to search through the fields or can use a column matcher with the segment ID and column specified (e.g. N4*2)  using Format Preserving encryption.

To execute, run *python main.py*.

The results will be placed inside of the *x12-masked* directory.
