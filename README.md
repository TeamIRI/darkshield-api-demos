# DarkShield RPC API Demos

A collection of demo projects for the *DarkShield* and *DarkShield-Files* APIs
using Python glue code.

You need to have Python3 installed on your system in order to execute these demos.

To start, it's recommended that you create an isolated Python 
[virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to avoid dependency 
bloat/clashes with your main system distribution.

To install the required dependencies, execute *pip install -r requirements.txt* 
(make sure your virtual environment is activated, or your dependencies will 
be installed globally).

Some demo projects also contain a *requirements.txt* file for additional 
dependencies that need to be installed in order to run that particular demo.

To execute the demos, execute *python main.py* from the directory of the demo.
